----------------------

Added

- Bytes send/receive counters with clear button

- Add app version to serial dialog window title at startup
- Changed port selection dialog behaviour: cancel doesn't close app and the

Fixes

- Add a line break when a paragraph (block size) becomes too large, as the

  slowdown when a lot of characters are received very fast, e.g. when
  connecting with the wrong buad rate.

  it will receive focus
- Window title text changed to "Port (baud) - Simple Serial Version" so one can
  easily see the port in the taskbar
